## Why Ibadah Lover as name?

At first it aimed to be for Dhikr Tracking (dhikr is a form of islamic worship that consist to thank Allah, ask for forgivenes, Glorify Allah and so on.) so it was Dhikr Count, but then idea of developing Salah Tracking made it rename to After Salah (afetr prayer, because dhikr is often done after prayer and it englobes the 2 purposes of the app). But then Idea of Implementing Quran tracking (to help with memorization and goals) made it rename to Ibadah Tracker. But then I didn't like tracker to be in it's name, even though it is a tracker. So when thinking about what to put after Ibadah I thought of Lover because I belief Love is one of the strongest Attributes so Ibadah Lover is end result.
